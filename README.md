# CNG476_forestFire
A system simulation model for early detection of forest fires using OSID (Open-area Smoke Imaging Detection) sensors, built with OMNeT++ and FLoRa. The simulation focuses on modeling a wide-area wireless sensor network to evaluate fire detection response times and coverage efficiency.
